### Story Entry Points

- Write a casefile for Cass: a client's problem, their hysterical supernatural theory, and Cass's mundane, technological diagnosis.
- Script a conversation between two household gods (Lares) gossiping over the domestic network about their owners' secrets.
- Describe a new 'spiritual-tech' product being hawked in the Forum, its absurd claims, and its sleek Latin marketing litter.
